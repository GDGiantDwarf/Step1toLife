# Step1toLife

This is the beginning of my project Called life.
I intend to try to make a 3D, procedurally generated Sandbox, with heavy simulation, akin to games like noita.
It currently uses the Raylib, which, while being a great starting point, is rather low on optimisations.
I intend to either make an game engine, or somehow use an other, sooner than later.

Controls are WASD / ZQSD depending on keboard
Q and E / A and E to move up and down.

dependencies :

sudo apt-get install libxrandr
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

usage : mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && ./Step1toLife

Thanks for Checking out my work!
